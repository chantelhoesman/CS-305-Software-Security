# CS-305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Our company was hired to conduct a vulnerability assessment of Artimis Financials secure communications.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
When the vulnerabilities were located I address methods to overcoming the vulnerabilities. I outlined paths they can take to secure the data. It is important to code securely to protect customer data from bad actors. The value of having security prevents breaches, which would decrease the chance of bad press hurting the customer’s bottom line. 
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging was the manual review of the code. I am not a great coder so to recognize where something is not secure was not easy.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
By investigating each portion of the areas of security from the vulnerability flow chart I was able to cover each vulnerable section for assessment as well as make individual suggestions on each portion. 
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I performed manual and a dependency check using OWASP. I performed one before I began and one after we completed the changes to see if any new vulnerabilities were created. 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Learned about OWASP dependency checks. Learned about spring boot and how to use it. 
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
That I can investigate, create, and evaluate security vulnerabilities.
